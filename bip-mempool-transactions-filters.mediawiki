== Abstract ==

This BIP describes a new addition to light client protocol defined in BIP 157. Block filters is privacy
safe approach to keep light clients synchronized but unlike BIP 37,  BIP 157  not allow to apply filters to 
mempool and check announcements for zero-confirmation transactions. 


== Motivation ==

BIP 157 is missed functionality to filter unconfirmed transactions. Light client that refused to use BIP 37 
due to privacy leaks can process unconfirmed transactions only one way and this is loading the entire mempool transaction flow. 

Daily transaction volume in Bitcoin blockchain is about 200,000 - 300,000 transactions and no less than 150 Mb of data.
This is the significant daily volume of traffic for a light wallets. Described in this BIP mempool transactions filters, 
it is not just for convenient notification of new transactions. Transactions filters improvement give ability 
for light clients instead of loading full blocks, simply request short transaction filters and full transactions only for the affected addresses. This approach consumes less bandwidth than loading full blocks and serving the entire flow of unconfirmed transactions.

== Specification ==

=== New messages ===

==== gettxfilters ====

The gettxfilter message is used to request transactions by transaction IDs with the specified filters to apply. 
ID length filed define length of transaction ID in bytes, 32 bytes means full 256-bit transaction ID, 6 bytes means short transactions IDs as defined in BIP 152 or 16 bytes truncated 128 bit witness transaction id.

{|class="wikitable"
! Field Size !! Description !! Data type !! Comments
|-
| 1 || ID length || uint8_t || Transaction ID length in bytes
|-
| 1-5  || filter type || var_int || Applied filter types
|-
| 1-5 || Elements count || var_int || Number of transaction IDs entries
|-
| variable  || transaction ID || List of byte[] || List of transaction IDs 
|}


==== txfilter ====

txfilter is sent in response to gettxfilters, one for each transaction in the requested list. The message contains the following fields:

{|class="wikitable"
! Field Size !! Description !! Data type !! Comments
|-
| 32 || transaction ID || byte[32] || Full transaction ID 
|-
| 1-5 || filter size || var_int || Filter length in bytes
|-
| variable  || filter || byte[] || GCS filter
|}

Filter types defined in BIP-block-batch-filters and determine which data is included in a transaction GCS filter.

==== gettxfilters ====

The gettxfilter message is used to request transactions by 256-bit transaction IDs with the specified filters to apply. 
ID length filed define length of transaction ID in bytes, 32 bytes means full transaction ID, 6 bytes means short transactions IDs as defined in BIP 152 or 16 bytes truncated wtx_id hash.

! Field Size !! Description !! Data type !! Comments

| 1 || ID length || uint8_t || Transaction ID length in bytes

| 1-5  || filter type || var_int || Applied filter types
|-
| 1-5 || Elements count || var_int || Number of transaction IDs entries
|-
| variable  || transaction ID || List of byte[] || List of transaction IDs 
|}


==== getcfproof ====

The getfilterproof message is used to request merkle proof to verify commitment as merkle root of merkle tree constructed from headers of all types of filters. In case the light client downloads all types filters and keep information about the prevoius block filters, the commitment can be calculated independently.

Merkle proof is sequence of 32 byte hashes necessary to build the path to the root from requested fiter types.

=== Synchronization protocol flow ===

Mempool transactions filters in combination with  BIP 152 allow light clients syncronize blockchain without downloading full 
blocks.   

<img src=bip-mempool-transactions-filters/schema_a.png></img>

The above diagram shows an example with set of unconfirmed transactions {A, B, C, D, E}. Transactions B and E is affected for 
light client. 

On fisrt part shown how light clinet respon for new transaction announces, requesting transaction filters that are significantly smaller than the transactions themselves. In case positive test on received filter, light client request full transaction data.

The second part shows the process of synchronizing a new block. Full node send <code>cmpctblock</code> message with block header and short transaction IDs. Light client request missed transaction filters {C,D,E} then request transactions affected in filters {E} and coinbase transaction. We need coinbase transaction downloaded to retrive witness commitment and block filters commitment. In case light client uses filter only certain types on additional comunication round required with message <code>getcfproof</code> to retrive merkle proof to filter commitment.

Last step is request block filters from full node and start verification process. One of the important point in this schema is comparison between block filters and all received transactions filters. The number of affected duplicate elements MUST be the same; a duplicate counter sequence is provided in the duplicate filter structure. In case this condition is not met, this means that same transaction filters hiding payments, because block filters could be verified via filters commitment. In this situation light client MUST download full block, find transaction with invalid filters and bun malicious node who sent this.


Described schema in part of commitment verification works only if in future soft-fork filters commitment will be included in block validation rules. Currently light client nodes trusting that full nodes do not hiding payments, this applies to both BIP 37 and BIP 157, commitment verificatin part should be ignored for now.

== Compatibility ==

Older clients remain fully compatible and interoperable after this change. 

Clients which do not implement this BIP remain fully compatible after this change using existing protocols, because this is 
additional node service and changes not affected to exist protocol.

== Reference Implementation ==
