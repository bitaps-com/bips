== Abstract ==

This BIP describes a new addition to light client protocol defined in BIP 157. Block filters is privacy
safe approach to keep light clients synchronized but unlike BIP 37,  BIP 157  not allow to apply filters to 
mempool and check announcements for zero-confirm transactions. 


== Motivation ==

BIP 157 is missed functionality to filter unconfirmed transactions, this means that Light client refused to use BIP 37 
due to privacy issues can process unconfirmed transactions only when loading the entire mempool transaction flow. 

Daily transaction volume in Bitcoin blockchain is about 200,000 - 300,000 transactions and no less than 150 Mb of data.
This is the significant daily volume of traffic for a wallet on a smartphone at example. Mempool filters this is not 
just user friendly fast notification about new transactions. This BIP described protocol improvement give ability 
for light clients do not download full blocks in case affected addresses in block detected and request short transactions
filters only exactly needed full transactions.

protocol and give ability for light clients request short transactions filters and  exactly needed full transactions 
instead of download full blocks.

== Specification ==

=== New messages ===


==== gettxfilters ====

The gettxfilter message is used to request transactions by 256-bit transaction IDs with the specified filters to apply. 
ID length filed define length of transaction ID in bytes for compatability with future protocol changes and optiomizations at example for use 128-bit truncated IDs.

{|class="wikitable"
! Field Size !! Description !! Data type !! Comments
|-
| 1 || ID length || uint8_t || Transaction ID length in bytes
|-
| 1-5 || Elements count || var_int || Number of applied filters
|-
| variable  || filter type || List of var_int || List of of applied filter types
|-
| 1-5 || Elements count || var_int || Number of transaction IDs entries
|-
| variable  || transaction ID || List of byte[] || List of transaction IDs 
|}


==== txfilter ====

txfilter is sent in response to gettxfilters, one for each transaction in the requested list. The message contains the following fields:

{|class="wikitable"
! Field Size !! Description !! Data type !! Comments
|-
| 32 || transaction ID || byte[32] || Full transaction ID 
|-
| 1-5 || filter size || var_int || Filter length in bytes
|-
| variable  || filter || byte[] || GCS filter
|}

Filter types defined in BIP-block-batch-filters and determine which data is included in a transaction GCS filter.
