== Abstract ==

This BIP describes a new addition to light client protocol defined in BIP 157. Block filters is privacy
safe approach to keep light clients synchronized but unlike BIP 37,  BIP 157  not allow to apply filters to 
mempool and check announcements for zero-confirm transactions. 


== Motivation ==

BIP 157 is missed functionality to filter unconfirmed transactions, this means that Light client refused to use BIP 37 
due to privacy issues can process unconfirmed transactions only when loading the entire mempool transaction flow. 

Daily transaction volume in Bitcoin blockchain is about 200,000 - 300,000 transactions and no less than 150 Mb of data.
This is the significant daily volume of traffic for a wallet on a smartphone at example. Mempool filters this is not 
just user friendly fast notification about new transactions. This BIP described protocol improvement give ability 
for light clients do not download full blocks in case affected addresses in block detected and request short transactions
filters only exactly needed full transactions.
